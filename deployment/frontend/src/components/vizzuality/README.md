To components work we need libs folders inside the vizzuality folder and the configuration in tailwind to define the extra small breakpoint

Take care to change the rest of the classes in the global.scss they are applying in the external libs components too

I didn't check if there are files that can be erased inside the layer-manager and react-sortable-hoc folders

These libs were also exported because they required older versions of react to work.
