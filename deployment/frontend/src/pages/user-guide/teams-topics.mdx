# Teams / Topics discovery page

These two pages are grouped because they have the same UI and functionality but the contained entity is different on each page

Using the topics page, you can visit the topic page via <b>/topics</b>

The page contains the search input field and the listed Topics. Each topic card contains the topic title, it description, and the number of datasets and Sub-Topics as shown below

<img src="/images/user-guide/team2.webp" />

Using the image below, this topic has 1 dataset and it has 1 sub-topic.

Since the default pages display list of Parent topics and topics without parent, by parent, I mean topics that have sub-topics; the search functionality is extensive enough for you to search through the sub-topics and it returns the Parent topics the sub-topic belongs to.

We searched for <b>hierarchy</b>, but the topic that has hirerachy in its title is a sub-topic, hence the parent is displayed, to view the sub-topic, you can click on the parent topic which leads us to the individual topic page

The individual topic page contains the Topic title and its description, it has a subtopics section. Currently, this Topic has only one, which is displayed as shown above.

It also has another section to display the list of datasets associated with this topic.

The whole process as described in this article applies to the Teams page.

export default function MDXPage({ children }) {
    return <MdxLayout>{children}</MdxLayout>
}
