# Auth

## Log in

To log in, users can find the "Login" button on the navbar on any page. Note that after logging in, this button changes to the name of the user, which when clicked opens a menu that allows users to access the dashboard and log out.

## Dashboard page

If a user tries to access the dashboard page without being logged in, he will get redirected to the homepage.

## Password reset

On the same login modal used for logging in, users can also reset their password. The password reset process is:

1) The users requests the password reset for the email address associated with his account
2) The user receives an email with a reset password link
3) Upon accessing the link, the user can choose a new password
4) After the password is successfuly reset, the user is automatically signed in
